# gl-math

A small math library aimed at gamedev that provides 4x4 float matrix, vector, and quaternion operations. Uses the [hypermath](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/hypermath) library.

## Installation
This repository is a [Chicken Scheme](https://call-cc.org/) egg.

It is part of the [Chicken egg index](https://eggs.call-cc.org/5/) and can be installed with `chicken-install gl-math`.

## Requirements
- srfi-1
- matchable

## Documentation
gl-math provides a number of functions for working with 4x4 matrices (plus a handful of others). The functionality is similar to what can be found in the [glm egg](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/glm), but with some notable differences:

- Matrix functions only operate on 4x4 matrices
- Matrix functions can accept either f32vectors or pointers
- No container is used to represent matrices

Additionally, gl-math is one fifth the compiled size of glm, has a more straight-forward code-base, and complete documentation.

gl-math expects matrices, vectors, and quaternions to be f32vectors or pointers. f32vectors must be 16 elements long, 3 elements long, or 4 elements long for matrices, vectors, or quaternions, respectively. The memory pointed to should likewise be an array of 16, 3, or 4 floats . If a function accepts more than one matrix, vector, or quaternion, all must be of the same type.

gl-math operates on matrices in a column-major fashion in correspondence with OpenGL (e.g. translation components are at indices 12, 13, and 14). Vectors are arranged as (`(x y z)`), and quaternions as (`(x y z w)`).

### Quaternion operations
Quaternions are expected to be normalized before they are used in certain functions (`quaternion-normalize!` may be used to do so). All the provided functions that create quaternions, create unit quaternions. 

The order of quaternion cross-multiplication is the inverse of the “standard” order, so a quaternion that has undergone a series or rotations will represent the same rotation as a marix that has gone through the same series, in the same order.
